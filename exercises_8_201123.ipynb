    "Simulating an experiment with a “Toy Experiment”\n",
    "Sequences of pseudo-random numbers are often used to simulate the statistical behavior of a measurement experiment or to perform numerical integrations.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the frequentist paradigm of statistics, uncertainties of a measurement are derived from its probability density distribution, assuming that the experiment used for that measurement is repeated a large number of times.\n",
    "\n",
    "Operationally, the experiment leading to the final measurement result is unique, so certain statistical behaviors can only be simulated.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simulation of a measurement experiment is called a toy experiment."
